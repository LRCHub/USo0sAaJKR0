[00:30.72] That can only mean one thing
[00:34.36] I know when that hotline bling
[00:37.91] That can only mean one thing
[00:51.91] 
[00:40.79] Ever since I left the city, you
[00:44.15] Got a reputation for yourself now
[00:47.78] Everybody knows and I feel left out
[00:51.39] Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
[00:54.85] Cause ever since I left the city, you
[00:58.44] Started wearing less and goin' out more
[01:01.94] Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
[01:05.44] Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
[01:28.44] 
[01:09.34] You used to call me on my cell phone
[01:13.38] Late night when you need my love

[01:41.47] You and me, we just don't get along
[01:44.89] You make me feel like I did you wrong
[01:48.48] Going places where you don't belong
[01:51.92] Ever since I left the city, you
[01:55.42] You got exactly what you asked for
[01:58.98] Running out of pages in your passport
[02:02.48] Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
[02:25.48] 
[02:06.30] You used to call me on my cell phone
[02:10.30] Late night when you need my love

[02:28.16] I know when that hotline bling
[02:31.85] That can only mean one thing
[02:45.85] 
[02:34.48] These days, all I do is
[02:36.47] Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
[02:39.66] Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
[02:43.37] Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
[02:47.06] You don't need no one else
[02:48.92] You don't need nobody else, no
[02:51.21] Why you never alone
[02:53.15] Why you always touching road
[02:55.04] Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
[02:57.38] You was in the zone, yeah
[02:59.75] You should just be yourself
[03:01.49] Right now, you're someone else
[03:16.49] 
[03:03.22] You used to call me on my cell phone
[03:07.38] Late night when you need my love
[03:10.93] Call me on my cell phone
[03:14.28] Late night when you need my love
[03:17.95] And I know when that hotline bling
[03:21.63] That can only mean one thing
[03:25.17] I know when that hotline bling
[03:28.67] That can only mean one thing
[03:42.67] 
[03:31.45] Ever since I left the city...
